### Resources & Support Needed
Need help for the **tOpos plugin**. Here is the	[tOpos plugin](https://www.food4rhino.com/en/app/topos)

Other links I found for guidance how to use the tOpos: 
[Topology Optimization with Grasshopper | topos Plugin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QFdhwXshaQ);
[Grasshopper | Recipe | Topology Optimization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6A2B3QnGv0);
[2020-35 LTH Tutorials: Generative Design from Structural Optimization ( tOpos+ Grasshopper )](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TyCVVoG-Do).

### Feedback & Revisions
Waiting for the video feedback to update this part

### Next Steps
documentation for phone stand.
A Rhino and Grasshopper course I found online, plaining to take it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKwHNzHK-jg; https://lemanoosh.com/grasshopper-3d-online-courses-for-designers-and-architects/; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZP1m0bzNkxQ&list=PLV5rPnGvmequIJmI1R4kq8kIQ7FtKrRiw.

# Hello DES INV 202 Student!
Welcome to your new GitHub repository! 

# Outline
[week 1](README.md#week-1-example-report-1)

week 2, etc...

# Github Background Information & Context
If you‚Äôre new to GitHub, you can think of this as a shared file space (like a Google Drive folder, or a like a USB drive that‚Äôs hosted online.) 

This is your space to store project files, videos, PDFs, notes, images, etc., and (hopefully, neatly) organize so it's easy for viewers (and you!) to navigate. That said, it‚Äôs super easy for you to share any file or folder with us (your TDF instructional team) - just send us the link!  As a start, feel free to simply add images to the `/assets` folder, which is located [here](/assets). 

The specific file that I‚Äôm typing into right now is the **README.md** for this repo. 
##### (üí° TIP: The .md indicates that we‚Äôre using [Markdown formatting.](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)) #####
<h6> (üí° TIP 2: GitHub Markdown supports <a href="https://gist.github.com/seanh/13a93686bf4c2cb16e658b3cf96807f2"> <em>HTML formatting</em> too, including emojis üòÑ</a>, in case that helps!) </h6>

### :star: Whatever you write in your **README.md** will show up on the ‚Äúfront page‚Äù of your GitHub repo. This is where we‚Äôll be looking for your [weekly progress reports](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/24f-desinv-202/wiki/3.0-Weekly-Submissions#weekly-progress-report). They might look something like this: ###

# Week 1: Example Report 1 #
## Week of 09/05/2024

It's time to start making this space your own! If you want to save these instructions, make a copy.  Also, feel empowered to delete everything in this README.md and start documenting! 

Excited to work with you,
your TDF teaching team

PS: let us know if you have any questions!!
