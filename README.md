# MIA'S WEEKLY REPORT ON DESIGN PROCESS
---
## WEEK 01

### Overview
This week, I installed Rhino 8 and began experimenting with 3D printing. These initial steps have helped me get acquainted with the updated software and explore fabrication techniques. Looking forward to diving deeper into these tools in the coming weeks.

### Key Accomplishments

## WEEK 02

### Overview
This week‚Äôs focus on Rhino, KeyShot, and Grasshopper has helped me build a foundation in computational design. I look forward to expanding these skills further.

### Key Accomplishments
**1. Learning Basic Rhino**

This week, I followed a Bilibili video course to learn the fundamentals of Rhino. I successfully completed two exercises:
"Á•ûÂ•áÂÆùË¥ùÁêÉ" (Pok√© Ball)
"ÈÅ•ÊéßÊåâÈíÆ" (Remote Button)
These exercises helped me get familiar with Rhino‚Äôs interface and basic modeling techniques.

**2. Exporting 3D Objects and Rendering in KeyShot**

After creating the 3D models in Rhino, I exported them and used KeyShot for rendering. This process allowed me to practice converting designs into photorealistic visuals, which is an essential part of design presentation.

**3. Exploring Grasshopper**

I started working with a Grasshopper file provided to us, where I experimented with modifying some parameters. I also attempted to change existing shapes through Grasshopper, giving me a better understanding of parametric design and computational design workflows.

### Next Steps
**1. Upcoming Tasks**
  - **Deadline: Thursday, Sep 19** Complete design process video for phone stand. 

**2. Skill Development**
  -  To further develop my Grasshopper skills, I plan to learn about data trees, which are essential for managing structured data in complex designs;
  -  I will explore the relationship between geometry and parameters to better understand how input changes dynamically affect design outputs.;
  -  I also intend to explore popular Grasshopper plug-ins, such as Kangaroo and Galapagos, to enhance my parametric design capabilities..
  -  To reinforce my learning, I plan to implement a small task by designing a toothbrush using Grasshopper.

## WEEK 03

### Overview
This week‚Äôs activities contributed to a deeper understanding of systems thinking, human-centered design, and fabrication methods, laying the groundwork for future project work.

### Key Accomplishments

**1. Completed the Phone Stand Design**

I finalized the phone stand design using various Grasshopper components, including "polygon," "division," "move," "rotate 3D," "explode," "shift list," "shortest list," "extrude point," "surface," and "brep join." These operations helped me create a precise and optimized design.

**2. Rendered the Phone Stand in KeyShot**

After completing the design, I rendered the phone stand with a phone in KeyShot to generate realistic visuals, further honing my rendering and presentation skills.

**3. Toothbrush Design in Grasshopper**

For the toothbrush project, I used advanced Grasshopper tools such as "construct domain," "range," "scale," "graph mapper," "loft," and "mirror" to develop a parametric model. This project deepened my understanding of how to manipulate parameters to create custom shapes.

**4. Fabrication: 3D Printed Both Designs**

I successfully 3D printed both the phone stand and the toothbrush, reinforcing my skills in turning digital models into physical objects and understanding manufacturing constraints. These activities helped reinforce my understanding of how digital designs are transformed into physical objects, as well as the considerations necessary to ensure precision and efficiency during fabrication.

**5. Experimenting with Plug-ins**

I attempted to use the Topos plugin for an additional task, but I encountered difficulties. This experience provided insight into potential areas for further exploration in plugin usage.

**6. Design Process Video**

I have uploaded a video on YouTube showcasing my design process. You can watch it [here](https://youtu.be/w1QVZrmQnsk).

### Ongoing Work

# Hello DES INV 202 Student!
Welcome to your new GitHub repository! 

# Outline
[week 1](README.md#week-1-example-report-1)

week 2, etc...

# Github Background Information & Context
If you‚Äôre new to GitHub, you can think of this as a shared file space (like a Google Drive folder, or a like a USB drive that‚Äôs hosted online.) 

This is your space to store project files, videos, PDFs, notes, images, etc., and (hopefully, neatly) organize so it's easy for viewers (and you!) to navigate. That said, it‚Äôs super easy for you to share any file or folder with us (your TDF instructional team) - just send us the link!  As a start, feel free to simply add images to the `/assets` folder, which is located [here](/assets). 

The specific file that I‚Äôm typing into right now is the **README.md** for this repo. 
##### (üí° TIP: The .md indicates that we‚Äôre using [Markdown formatting.](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)) #####
<h6> (üí° TIP 2: GitHub Markdown supports <a href="https://gist.github.com/seanh/13a93686bf4c2cb16e658b3cf96807f2"> <em>HTML formatting</em> too, including emojis üòÑ</a>, in case that helps!) </h6>

### :star: Whatever you write in your **README.md** will show up on the ‚Äúfront page‚Äù of your GitHub repo. This is where we‚Äôll be looking for your [weekly progress reports](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/24f-desinv-202/wiki/3.0-Weekly-Submissions#weekly-progress-report). They might look something like this: ###

# Week 1: Example Report 1 #
## Week of 09/05/2024
