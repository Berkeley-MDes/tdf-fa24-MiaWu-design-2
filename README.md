## WEEK 02
09/06/2024 - 09/12/2024

### Overview
This week’s focus on Rhino, KeyShot, and Grasshopper has helped me build a foundation in computational design. I look forward to expanding these skills further.

### Key Accomplishments
**1. Learning Basic Rhino**

This week, I followed a Bilibili video course to learn the fundamentals of Rhino. I successfully completed two exercises:
"神奇宝贝球" (Poké Ball)
"遥控按钮" (Remote Button)
These exercises helped me get familiar with Rhino’s interface and basic modeling techniques.

**2. Exporting 3D Objects and Rendering in KeyShot**

After creating the 3D models in Rhino, I exported them and used KeyShot for rendering. This process allowed me to practice converting designs into photorealistic visuals, which is an essential part of design presentation.

**3. Exploring Grasshopper**

I started working with a Grasshopper file provided to us, where I experimented with modifying some parameters. I also attempted to change existing shapes through Grasshopper, giving me a better understanding of parametric design and computational design workflows.

## WEEK 03
09/13/2024 - 09/19/2024

### Overview
This week’s activities contributed to a deeper understanding of systems thinking, human-centered design, and fabrication methods, laying the groundwork for future project work. These tasks helped deepen my proficiency in Rhino, Grasshopper, and KeyShot while also reinforcing my fabrication skills through 3D printing.

### Key Accomplishments

**1. Completed the Phone Stand Design**

I finalized the phone stand design using various Grasshopper components, including "polygon," "division," "move," "rotate 3D," "explode," "shift list," "shortest list," "extrude point," "surface," and "brep join." These operations helped me create a precise and optimized design.

**2. Rendered the Phone Stand in KeyShot**

After completing the design, I rendered the phone stand with a phone in KeyShot to generate realistic visuals, further honing my rendering and presentation skills.

**3. Toothbrush Design in Grasshopper**

For the toothbrush project, I used advanced Grasshopper tools such as "construct domain," "range," "scale," "graph mapper," "loft," and "mirror" to develop a parametric model. This project deepened my understanding of how to manipulate parameters to create custom shapes.

**4. Fabrication: 3D Printed Both Designs**

I successfully 3D printed both the phone stand and the toothbrush holder, reinforcing my skills in turning digital models into physical objects and understanding manufacturing constraints. These activities helped reinforce my understanding of how digital designs are transformed into physical objects, as well as the considerations necessary to ensure precision and efficiency during fabrication.

## WEEK 04
09/20/2024 - 09/26/2024

### Overview
This week, I made significant progress with the Topos plugin in Grasshopper, learning how to input material properties, set boundary conditions, and run optimizations. This helped create efficient structures for my design projects. I also completed the second phone stand design using Topos in Grasshopper and Rhino, ensuring stability while maintaining the aesthetic and functional requirements. Lastly, I finalized the documentation for Project 1, detailing the parametric and generative design processes and outcomes. This week's focus was on advancing my computational design skills and completing key project deliverables.

### Key Accomplishments
